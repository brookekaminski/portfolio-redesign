            <p><span class="bold">All these weird things that I’ve done</span> I’ve included to showcase this project not based on whether I believe it was successful web project or not but to show my attitude towards my work. I got into my mind that I wanted a video double exposure, where the video faded into a photo to create a double exposure. I can’t tell you where this idea came from or why I wanted to do it, i just did. This was for my personal landing page at school, and I wanted to do something that would showcase my personality. If I get an idea I will try to execute it. I will give it my all to try to make it work. I will go into the ocean in October and stand in the icy waves until my vision becomes reality. And then I will laugh about it.
