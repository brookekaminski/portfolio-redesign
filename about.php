        <p><span class="bold">What I love about the web | </span>We are in this space where anything is possible, where dynamic, interactive art becomes accessible for all. Where else can you be communicating with people all over the world while interacting and imagining the impossible for free? That’s a really beautiful thing, and that’s why I’m here. To be part of this experience and to try to make it better and more accessible for everyone, so they can feel the same as I do about this wonderful medium.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Who I am | </span>Originally from Vancouver, I began my academic journey in urban planning and visual arts in Saskatoon with the goal of going into architecture. I wanted to find a way to mix my creative and technical skills. I was then accepted in my third year to the University of British Columbia's Environmental Design program where I obtained my degree. After graduation I began working for a start-up company where we had to wear many hats. I helped to redesign their online scheduling website and that's where I fell in love with coding. I realized it was the perfect way to blend logic and design.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Where I am now | </span>I just graduated in March from the British Columbia Institute of Technology's Technical Web Designer program which was a six month intensive program where we learned HTML, CSS, SCSS, Git,  JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, and Wordpress. We also explored UX design, accessibility, SEO strategies, and client and team relationships. A week and a half after the program ended, I headed out to Toronto to explore a new city and seek opportunities.</p>
