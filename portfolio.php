                <p><span class="bold">This is me</span> My portfolio is meant to showcase work, so I wanted it to be simple, fast, and easy to use to not waste anyoneâ€™s time. I focused on this by making sure everything was optimized. The design is simple and clean to make it easy to view information efficiently. Also, I care about inclusive design so I wanted to make sure it was easy to view and use for all users by being mindful of users of screen readers and keyboard only.</p> <a class="button" href="https://brookekaminski.ca/">View Live<span class="screen-reader-text"> internal link to my portfolio home page</span></a> </section>

                <p> I started by getting an idea of what the content would be and made some rough wireframes to lay it all out. I was pretty set on a simple layout framed by a thick border with an image gallery of my projects. </p>

                <h3 class="section-titles">Mobile Process</h3>
                <p>After learning how to approach a website desktop down, I wanted to make sure I also went mobile first. Below are my design iterations, I like to do a pretty visual mockup. This usually helps me work out some of the design bugs as I usually do more than one. Because this is my portfolio, I did more than usual which ended up being roughly 5 variations.</p>
